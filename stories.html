                I wanted to bootstrap a game to introduce my kids to programming. They've always been curious about how games are made, and I kept giving them the usual excuses: Game development takes a lot of time and resources, it requires extensive testing, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                I tried revisiting Godot and Unity on weekends to quickly prototype something, but getting back into these tools took more time than expected. Though I had used both in the past, the learning curve was still steep. Back in the day, I coded my first game in Assembly and Turbo Pascal, which took me a full year. So, the question was: how can we bootstrap ideas faster?

              <p>
                In this chapter of "The Mythology of Software Engineering," we discuss technical debt. What does it mean, and how should we handle it as software engineers or as technical leads/principal engineers?
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's take a step back and examine a famous Greek myth that illustrates the process of managing technical debt. The Battle of Hercules against the Hydra is a well-known Greek myth in which Hercules, a hero, battled a multi-headed serpent-like creature called the Hydra. The Hydra had the ability to grow two heads for every one that was cut off. With the assistance of his nephew Iolaus, Hercules defeated the Hydra by severing its heads and cauterising the stumps to prevent them from regrowing. Ultimately, he succeeded in slaying the creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar challenges arise when dealing with technical debt in software engineering. We attempt to adapt our current code/software architecture to new requirements, but most of the time, we must make trade-offs. Whether this trade-off results in technical debt or not, we will decide later during our discussion of what is actually considered technical debt or messy code. However, the comparison with the myth is fitting. We strive to manage a challenge, but we inadvertently introduce more complexity. How can we handle this complexity like Hercules?

              <p>
                Throughout my career, I've encountered various interpretations of what developer experience (DX) means to different people. It's evident in the way major companies, like Google and Microsoft, continually refine their products to simplify development for others and make it more accessible to a wider audience. In this article, however, I want to focus on my personal approach to delivering high-quality code and define what constitutes a good DX for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's draw a parallel between DX and a tale from Norse mythology: the story of Jörmungandr, the Midgard Serpent. In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr is a massive sea serpent, born of the god Loki. Odin threw it into the ocean, where it grew so large that it could encircle the earth and bite its own tail. The serpent's ultimate battle with Thor is foretold to occur during Ragnarök, where Thor will vanquish Jörmungandr. This tale fascinates me because neither Thor nor Jörmungandr can truly win. This is analogous to the ongoing struggle between software engineers and the pursuit of ideal DX. It's a perpetual challenge, with each side striving for supremacy, yet it's a battle without end.
